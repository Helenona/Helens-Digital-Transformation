        <h2>Project A — UX Redesign for Campus Cafe (Group)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Frontend lead & UI prototyper</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The cafe’s online menu and ordering process were confusing, which led to lots of phone orders and mistakes.</p>
        <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I helped design a clickable Figma prototype and translated it into a responsive HTML/CSS prototype. I focused on simplifying the user journey and making the menu easy to navigate.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Testing with stakeholders showed fewer order mistakes and a clearer, smoother online ordering experience, helping the cafe reduce phone workload.</p>

        <h2>Project B — Accessibility Improvements (Individual)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Accessibility auditor & implementer</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A university webpage was difficult to use for some users due to low contrast and missing ARIA roles.</p>
        <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I audited the page, then improved contrast, keyboard navigation, and added ARIA labels. I also documented the changes so others could continue improving accessibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The page passed basic WCAG checks, making it more usable and inclusive for all users.</p>

        <h2>Project C — Problem-Solving Page Design Concept (Restaurant Case Study)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Acting CTO & lead designer</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A local restaurant had no online presence for bookings or customer engagement. They relied on walk-ins, which made managing reservations and feedback tricky.</p>
        <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I designed a prototype page that included social links, contact info, and a simple booking/feedback form that generates an email (simulated). I focused on a clean layout and intuitive flow so visitors could easily understand the restaurant’s offerings and take action.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The prototype gave the restaurant a clear, practical starting point that could be handed to developers for production, improving potential engagement and bookings.</p>

        <h3>Design Concept & Why</h3>
        <p>The page follows a simple, linear flow: situation → value proposition → booking form → contact & socials. This makes it easy for visitors to understand the business, take action, and verify contact info. Forms are lightweight and client-side validated to match the brief’s "no live database" requirement while still producing an actionable email for the restaurant.</p>
