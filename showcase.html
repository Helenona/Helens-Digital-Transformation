        <h2>Project A — UX Redesign for Campus Cafe (Group)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Frontend lead & UI prototyper.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The cafe's online menu and ordering flow were unclear, causing high phone orders and frequent mistakes.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Produced a clickable prototype (Figma) and a responsive HTML/CSS prototype. Stakeholder testing showed reduced order confusion in user tests and a clear path to reduce phone workload.</p>

        <h2>Project B — Accessibility Improvements (Individual)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Accessibility auditor & implementer.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A university web page had low contrast and missing ARIA roles, making it difficult for some users.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Delivered an annotated report and updated HTML/CSS demonstrating improved contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels — validated against basic WCAG checks.</p>

      <article class="project-card">
        <h2>Project C — Problem-Solving Page Design Concept (Restaurant Case Study)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Acting CTO & lead designer for the case study.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A local restaurant lacked an online presence for bookings + customer engagement; they received a lot of walk-ins but had no streamlined booking or feedback channel.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Created a prototype Problem-Solving Page that integrates social links, contact details, and a booking/feedback form which generates an email to the restaurant manager (simulated). This served as a minimum viable feature set that could be handed to developers for production.</p>

        <h3>Design concept & why</h3>
        <p>The Problem-Solving Page uses a simple, linear layout: situation → value proposition → booking form → contact & socials. This order reduces friction: visitors immediately understand the business goal, can take action (book/feedback) and then verify contact/social proof. Forms are lightweight and validated on the client side to match the brief's "no live database" requirement while still producing an actionable email for the restaurant.</p>
