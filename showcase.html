    <h1 class="page-title warm-title">Business Showcase — Selected Projects</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Here are three projects I’ve worked on to strengthen my skills in web development, UX, and collaborative design. 
      Each project reflects real-world challenges, my approach, and the results I achieved.
    </p>

    <section class="projects">

      <!-- PROJECT 1 -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Personal Portfolio Website (Independent Project, 2024)</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>My Role:</strong> Designer & Developer</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> I wanted to create a personal portfolio to showcase my skills and projects, balancing design aesthetics with clarity and accessibility.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>What I Did:</strong> I designed the layout in Figma, built it with HTML and CSS, and focused on making it fully responsive and user-friendly. I also added subtle animations for engagement.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Outcome:</strong> The portfolio became a polished site I could use for job applications, improving my front-end development skills and confidence in independent work.
        </p>

      <!-- PROJECT 2 -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Accessibility Website Audit (Independent Project, 2024)</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>My Role:</strong> Researcher & Implementer</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Many small websites lacked accessibility features, making navigation difficult for users with screen readers or visual impairments.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>What I Did:</strong> I performed a full accessibility audit on a local business website, identified issues like low contrast and missing alt text, and suggested improvements. I created a simple prototype demonstrating better accessibility practices.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Outcome:</strong> The prototype addressed key accessibility issues and provided clear recommendations for future development, giving me practical experience in inclusive design.

      <!-- PROJECT 3 -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Group Presentation: Business Process Analysis (Group Assignment, 2024)</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>My Role:</strong> Researcher & Slide Designer</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Problem:</strong> Our group had to analyze a real business process and present findings in a clear, engaging way. Coordinating work and aligning everyone’s ideas was challenging.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>What I Did:</strong> I gathered data, designed slides for clarity and impact, and collaborated to integrate everyone’s research. I also helped manage deadlines and ensure the presentation was cohesive.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>The Outcome:</strong> The presentation was well-received, showing a clear understanding of the process. I learned valuable teamwork skills, communication, and how to compromise when working in a group.
