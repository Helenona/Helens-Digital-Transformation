    <h1 class="page-title warm-title">Business Showcase — Selected Projects</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
      A collection of early-stage digital projects, prototypes, and redesigns I created during university and independent learning.
      Each project focuses on solving real business or user experience challenges through simple, thoughtful design.

    <section class="projects">

      <!-- PROJECT A -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Project A — UX Redesign for Campus Café</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>Role:</strong> Frontend Lead & UI Prototyper</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> The café’s online menu and ordering flow confused students, causing heavy phone orders and frequent mistakes.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>My Approach:</strong> I designed a clearer, more intuitive menu layout in Figma and created a responsive HTML/CSS prototype.
          I simplified the user journey by reducing clicks, improving visual clarity, and making common items easy to find.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> User testing showed improved navigation, fewer errors, and a smoother ordering experience,
          reducing staff workload and phone queries.
        </p>

      <!-- PROJECT B -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Project B — Accessibility Improvements (Individual)</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>Role:</strong> Accessibility Auditor & Implementer</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> A university webpage had low contrast, unclear navigation, and missing ARIA roles,
          making it difficult for screen reader and keyboard users.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>My Approach:</strong> I carried out an accessibility audit, improved text contrast, added semantic structure,
          labelled interactive elements, and enhanced keyboard navigation.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> The updated page passed key WCAG checks and became more inclusive and user-friendly
          for students with accessibility needs.
        </p>
      </article>

      <!-- PROJECT C -->
      <article class="project-card warm-card">
        <h2 class="warm-section-title">Project C — Restaurant Problem-Solving Case Study</h2>
        <p class="warm-text"><strong>Role:</strong> Acting CTO & Lead Designer</p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> A local restaurant lacked any structured online system for bookings, feedback,
          or digital customer engagement.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>My Approach:</strong> I built a lightweight prototype page including a booking/feedback form that generates
          an email preview, social media integration, and clear business information.
          The design stays simple, intuitive, and user-centred.
        </p>

        <p class="warm-text">
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> The prototype provides a strong starting foundation the restaurant could hand off
          to developers and begin improving customer engagement online.
        </p>

        <h3 class="warm-section-title">Design Concept & Reasoning</h3>
        <p class="warm-text">
          The layout follows a clear flow: problem → value → action. Forms are kept lightweight
          (no live backend required for this coursework) but still practical with automatic email generation.
          This reflects realistic business needs while fitting within the assessment brief.
